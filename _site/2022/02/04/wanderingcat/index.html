Little did Shy knew that he could become a wandering cat.</p><p>Mon is his soul other, and they have been away for some time, thatâ€™s why they were cherishing the moment on which they could be together, forever. In the past there were days were Shy and Mon would run together through the streets of a great and big city and then sit down by the shored of the big pacific ocean. They were happy walking, painting and playing together. Shy had to go far away, he promised Mon a house were they could be happy togeter, and take care of each other. This was their dream house, because they would be in it.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/two-cats.jpg#full" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>The days passed and Shy and Mon would always make sure to look at the Moon and communicate. They never missed a single day of communication because the Moon reflected their love and their feelings, it was good enough until Mon could go home with Shy. One day, Shy stepped outside home, there was a cold storm that catched on him, this was not a normal storm, it was a mental storm infused with confusion that made him walk without direction for many days. Because, Shy instead of returning home, wandered alone in a path of cold regret, pain and shame. Every step that Shy made, drove him further away from home. One day, he looked back, and there was just a fuzzy image of the house on the horizon. Shy realized that he was lost, that the storm was driving him away to more agony.</p><p>He started his way back home, every step back was gelid, Shy fear that the house would be closed due to the storm, but he kept walking, he only got hope that he could at least get one chance to enter again and eventually see Mon with him one day, in their home.</p><p>When Shy was thinking on Mon, his heart would start pounding because she was always for him, he knew that Mon would make the house the best place he could wish and now he was scared of not seeing her again. On the storm, every thougth was hard to keep from the fear of dying without Mon and being lost forever, every breath was a gelid reminder of being a wandering cat.</p><p>One day, Shy found his house, the storm tore down many windows and inside was destroyed, Shy cried for eveything he had caused to the house he wanted to share with Mon. He entered the house, and immediatly he knew that Mon was worth it starting the house again. Shy picked up a little hammer and started fixing the windows. He will not stop until the house is once again ready for Mon.</p></div><ul class="post__social"><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/2022/02/04/wanderingcat/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=A wandering cat+http://localhost:4000/2022/02/04/wanderingcat/+by+Just Otter User" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://localhost:4000/2022/02/04/wanderingcat/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-google-plus"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=A wandering cat&summary=&url=http://localhost:4000/2022/02/04/wanderingcat/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http://localhost:4000/2022/02/04/wanderingcat/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://localhost:4000/2022/02/04/wanderingcat/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-reddit-alien"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=http://localhost:4000/2022/02/04/wanderingcat/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-tumblr"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/link/?description=&media=http://localhost:4000/assets/images/bwcat.jpg&url=http://localhost:4000/2022/02/04/wanderingcat/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by Just Otter User</span><p class="post__bio"></p></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2022/02/04/wanderingcat/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/bwcat.jpg" alt="A wandering cat"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">A wandering cat</h2></div></a></article></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="subscribe" id="subscribe"><div class="subscribe__container"> <span class="subscribe__title">Subscribe</span><p class="subscribe__text">Get a weekly email of posts Iâ€™ve added to the site.</p><form method="POST" action="https://samesies.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post-json?u=66ddf555dab480e6a8606430b&amp;id=89b3ee034f&amp;c=?" id="mc-signup" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" novalidate><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"> <input type="text" name="b_66ddf555dab480e6a8606430b_89b3ee034f" tabindex="-1" value=""></div><div class="form-group"> <input id="mce-EMAIL" type="email" name="EMAIL" placeholder="Email Address"></div><div class="form__btn"> <input id="mc-submit" type="submit" value="Sign Up" name="subscribe"></div></form><p class="subscribe__error hidden"></p></div></div><hr class="sep--white"/><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__tags"><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/dummy-text">Dummy Text</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/moon-drinking">Moon Drinking</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/kale">Kale</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/squid">Squid</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/mixtape">Mixtape</a></li></ul></div></div></footer><section class="contact popup"><div class="popup__close"><div class="popup__exit"></div></div><div class="contact__container popup__container"><div class="contact__img"><figure class="absolute-bg" style="background-image: url(/assets/images/placeholder-28.jpg);"></figure></div><div class="contact__content"><div class="contact__mast section-padding--half"><div class="grid"><h2>Contact</h2></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><hr class="sep"/></div><div class="contact__form section-padding--half"><div class="grid-xlarge"> <form id="form" class="form" action="https://formcarry.com/s/HkIo0nMb7" method="POST"><div class="form__subcontainer"><div> <label for="form-first-name">First Name</label> <input type="text" name="first-name" id="form-first-name" required></div><div> <label for="form-last-name">Last Name</label> <input type="text" name="last-name" id="form-last-name" required></div></div><div> <label for="form-email">E-Mail</label> <input type="email" name="email" id="form-email" required></div><div> <label for="form-message">Message</label> <textarea name="message" id="form-message" rows="3"></textarea></div><div class="form__submit"><div class="form__btn"> <input type="submit" value="Send"></div></div><p class="form__message"></p></form></div></div></div></div></section><script src="/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
