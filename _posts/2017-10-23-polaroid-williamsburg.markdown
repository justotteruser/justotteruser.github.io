I am the husband of a wonderful cat-lover, I want to let her know how wonderful she is and sometimes I don't have words for it. I will let my keystrokes be better than me to always give her what is deserved. 

I like poetry but I must admit I have no experience, in consequence, I do free style poems that I hope have more impact on their meaning than in the play of the English words and intontations. I also like to create little stories about everyday events, because there is complexity in every single episode of life. I must say, I am a bit fanatic of Chaos and Desperation, probably because sometimes I fail to life and fall into them and other times because I know there is order in Chaos and there are solutions for a lot of things in life.
