They say my gaze is lost, my aim twisted and in silence I wander.   

Oh, if they knew  

Prideful solitude plucked my eyes, and no one shall know,  
    
Prideful solitude plucked my eyes, but I will walk.  

Of the horizon, I don’t know, but I want to go back.  

I’m losing my heart, and yet I can’t stop.  

I’ve seen the end of my journey, only on slippery dreams,   

I’ve seen the end of my journey, on revived memories.  

Sometimes I stop … and this is not yet home.

I feel I was born in confusion and fear,   

Where jail was my room, and honor was exctint.  

I wished to cry and break my bones, but I'm not even worthy of that  

Silence is my confident and my destruction   

Will I die alone? Surely I don't want that

Mistakes have brought my jail, silence please give me light  

I clasp your hand hard, I am far away but life has prepared unavoidable ropes  

Love, I know I carry a sin, and I know I deserve it  

I wish I know the future, where I’ve been rescued from my past  

The fateful steps are agonizing, silence fills my soul  

I need air and I am disappearing even when I scream, silence will extinguish my voice  

I need to survive, I need you back
